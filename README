QUADRATICS

Small Java program that I use when teaching quadratic equations and
quadratic functions. For the function f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c this program
will print the zeros (if they exist), the vertex, and will also draw a graph
of the equation.

Furthermore, given three non-collinear points, this program shall also
provide the quadratic function which passes through thoe points.

This program is actually easy to do, mathematically. It is the user
interface that makes this program so tedious to create.
